# Knowledge Base Generation Tool (SKGT)

[sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html) is required to build the project.

From the main directory, run

```sh
sbt assembly
```

A **jar** file will be compiled to the `target/scala-2.13` directory.

This can be run using

```sh
scala skgt-assembly-*.0.jar
```
